# Install MySQL


```
yum -y install http://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-community-release-el6-5.noarch.rpm



yum repolist all | grep mysql
```


yum -y install mysql-community-server


service mysqld start
 


Note that you could runn the command "mysql_secure_installation" to do all of the following for you. However, it appears to require user interaction so it does not work for a fully scriptable setup (making it unnacceptable for our use case).

Instead, run:

```
mysqladmin -u root password __YOUR_NEW_PASSWORD_HERE__
```

Then login to mysql using:
```
mysql -u root -p
```

And enter your password when prompted. Then run the following MySQL commands to make your database more secure:

```
SELECT * FROM mysql.user;
DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE user='';
DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE user='root' AND host NOT IN ('localhost', '127.0.0.1', '::1');
DROP DATABASE test;
```
