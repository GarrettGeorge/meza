This manual is exactly as the name implies: directions for **manual** setup.

## Table of Contents
1. [Setting up VirtualBox](SettingUpVirtualBox.md)
2. [Installing CentOS](InstallingCentOS.md)
3. [Configuring CentOS](ConfiguringCentOS.md)
4. [Stuff that's not yet in actual chapters](CentOS_Notes.md)
100. [References](References.md)

This is still very much in development. For current work see [Open Work](OpenWork.md). For notes on things we don't think need to be incorporated into manual or build scripts, see [Closed Work](ClosedWork.md).
